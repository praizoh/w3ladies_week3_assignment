###Module 2: Week 3 Assignment

##Practical question.

Using Remix Development tools or Hardhat Development write a smart contract that records the database of students in a class.	Hint the knowledge of struct, mapping, and variable data type will be needed, The expected functions are

- A function that allows you to register a student,
- A function that allows you to see the record of a student using the student Id(The id can be any data type you want).
- You can also add as many functions as needed depending on your creativity.

##Theory Questions

Explain the difference between the following terms in the smart contract.

1. ###A view function and pure function
